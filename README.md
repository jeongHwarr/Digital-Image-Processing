## HW 1
1. Displaying High Dynamic Range Images
  * (b) Convert to grayscale image
  * (c) Apply a gamma-nonlinearity mapping to grayscale images
  * (d) Apply a gamma-non linearity to red,green,and blue components (same value/different values for each of the color components)

2. Denoising for Astrophotography
  * (a) Generate a single denoised image from video without frame alignment
  * (b) Generate a single denoised image from video with frame alignment

3. Image Subtraction for Tampering Detection
  * Detect the tampered regions (tampered->white / non-tampered->black)

4. Nighttime Road Contrast Enhancement
  * (a) Plot and Submit the histogram of the original image's grayscale value
  * (b) Apply global histogram equalization
  * (c) Apply locally adaptive hisogram equalization

All output is stored in the output directory of each folder.
